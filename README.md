# dotfiles

Here's some configuration and stuff I useâ€¦ for now.

## Updates:

### April 2023

Got sick of trying to manually copy over dotfiles, so now I'm following this method: [Managing my dotfiles as a git repository
](https://drewdevault.com/2019/12/30/dotfiles.html). We'll see how it goes!

Also trying out [direnv](https://direnv.net/) as recommended by a colleague. Very handy!

### January 2023

Switched from VS Code to [Alacritty](https://alacritty.org/), [Neovim](https://neovim.io), and [tmux](https://tmux.github.io/) over the holiday break, and I'm loving it so far!
